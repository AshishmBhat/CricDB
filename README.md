The project is about managing a cricket team.

It allows a casual user to search a player and thus view his personal information and performance records.
The search can be done with Name or other filters like no.of centuries, no.of wickets taken etc.

The admin has to update the performance records of each player after a match using the admin section.
The admin can also delete a player or update other information on players.
